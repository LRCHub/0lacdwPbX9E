Sweetness
so spin with the girls in the parking lot
she says yes i'd like to get to know you
you can't see so i will show

i'm not sorry
not sorry
say sorry
say so

i'm not sorry (no never)
not sorry (never never)
say sorry (say never)
say so

and if it feels alright (feels alright)
she may not be the right one
and if it takes all night (takes all night)
it may not be the right time

yes i'd like to get to know you
you can't see so i will show you
yes i'd like to get to know you
you can't see so i will show

and if it feels alright (feels alright)
she may not be the right one
and if it takes all night (takes all night)
it may not be the right time

don't go
don't you tell me no
don't go
don't go
tell me something I don't know
break down this wall

(So I said... So I said it out)

and if it feels alright (feels alright)
she may not be the right one
and if it takes all night (takes all night)
it may not be the right time

the right time
the right one

No one knows who's sorry
No one ever knows who's sorry now
